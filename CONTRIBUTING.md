## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you find a bug, please open an [Issue](https://github.com/mateoltd/spline-research/issues) with:

-  A **clear** and descriptive title.  
-  Steps to reproduce the bug.  
-  Expected vs actual behaviour.  
-  Any relevant screenshots or logs.  
-  Your environment (OS, Node.js version).

### Suggesting Enhancements

Want to propose a new feature or improvement? Open an Issue with:

-  A summary of the idea.  
-  Why it is useful or how it improves the project.  
-  Any mockups, sketches, or links to reference implementations.

### Submitting Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create a topic branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/your-feature
   ```

2. Make your changes in that branch.  
3. Ensure linting, formatting, and tests pass:

   ```bash
   npm install        # if dependencies changed
   npm run lint
   npm test
   ```

4. Commit your changes following our [Commit Guidelines](#branch--commit-guidelines).  
5. Push to your fork and open a Pull Request against `main`.  
6. Fill in the PR template:

   - What does this change?  
   - Why is this change needed?  
   - How was it tested?  
   - Any additional notes or references.

## Branch & Commit Guidelines

### Branch Naming

-  `feat/<short-description>` for new features  
-  `fix/<short-description>` for bug fixes  
-  `docs/<short-description>` for documentation only changes  
-  `test/<short-description>` for adding or updating tests  
-  `refactor/<short-description>` for code changes that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature  

### Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
<type>(<scope>): <short summary>
 
[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

-  **type**: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`  
-  **scope**: a noun describing the section (e.g. `parser`, `build`)  
-  **short summary**: max 72 characters  
-  Use the imperative mood (‚ÄúAdd feature‚Äù not ‚ÄúAdded feature‚Äù).  

Example:

```
feat(parser): implement scene-file header parsing

Detailed explanation of what and why‚Ä¶
```
